4. A government research lab has concluded that an artificial sweetener commonly used in diet soda
pop will cause death in laboratory mice. A friend of yours is desperate to lose weight but cannot
give up soda pop. Your friend wants to know how much diet soda pop it is possible to drink without
dying as a result. Write a program to supply the answer. The program has no input but does have
defined constants for the following items: the amount of artificial sweetener needed to kill a
mouse, the weight of the mouse, the starting weight of the dieter, and the desired weight of the
dieter. To ensure the safety of your friend, be sure the program uses the weight at which the dieter
will stop dieting, rather than the dieterâ€™s current weight, to calculate how much soda pop the
dieter can safely drink. You may use any reasonable values for these defined constants. Assume that
diet soda contains 1/10th of 1% artificial sweetener. Use another named constant for this fraction.
You may want to express the percent as the double value 0.001. (If your program turns out not to use
a defined constant, you may remove that defined constant from your program.)
